# Squarization


1. Prepare an image file and text file in the same directory as the python file. It's better to use a png image without backgrounds. Short text can be concluded in weird output. We suggest you use a text file with 200 - 1000 characters.

2. run
``` python
python squarization.py
```
and follow the direction.

3. If the output differs from your desirable output, try another image file or adjust the number of characters in your text file.

These are your sample output with "dog.png, inputText.txt".
