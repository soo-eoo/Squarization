# Squarization


------------

``` python
pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow
```

with
``` python
python version 3.7.6
opencv-python 4.1.2
pillow 7.2.0
```
------------

1. Prepare an image file and text file in the same directory as the python file. It's better to use a png image without backgrounds. Short text can be concluded in weird output. We suggest you use a text file with 200 - 1000 characters.

2. run
``` python
python squarization.py
```
and follow the direction. Your ouputs will be saved as 'final_image.png' and 'final_letter_image.png'

3. If the output differs from your desirable output, try another image file or adjust the number of characters in your text file.

These are your sample output with "dog.png, inputText.txt".
